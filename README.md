## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub. 👀

P.S.: 
Since ent_create does not work on the server and asks FCVAR_CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE, I decided to make a soccer ball spawn plugin for myself. Perhaps it will be useful to someone as an example of using Utilities.CreateEntityByName 😉
