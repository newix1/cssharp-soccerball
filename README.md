# ⚽️ Soccerball
A simple plugin on Cssharp that allows you to spawn soccer ball.

## ⭐ Features

- Spawn proper physics red balls on command !sb

## 🔧 Installation

1. ⬇️ Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
2. 📁 Extract the ZIP file.
3. 📂 Place the plugin in the `game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/Soccerball` directory.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub. 👀

P.S.: 
Since ent_create does not work on the server and asks FCVAR_CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE, I decided to make a soccer ball spawn plugin for myself. Perhaps it will be useful to someone as an example of using Utilities.CreateEntityByName 😉
